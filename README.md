# UNK Syllabus Template
A LaTex template for use at University of Nebraska at Kearney. **Please note** that the template includes code for inserting book images, which I do not include here.

Based on a template by Arman Shokrollahi (\href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en}{CC BY 4.0}) and by James Quinlan (\href{https://github.com/aws/mit-0}{MIT License}). You can see the original repository at <https://github.com/jamesquinlan/syllabus-template>.
